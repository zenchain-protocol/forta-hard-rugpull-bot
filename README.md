# Hard Rugpull Detection Agent

## Description

This agent attempts to detect various types of hard rugpulls:
1. Honeypot: Token holders are unable to transfer their tokens.
2. Hidden Mints: Tokens can be minted using hidden functions.
3. Fake Ownership Renunciation: Renounced owners can recover ownership.
4. Hidden Fee Modifier: Transfer fees can be modified using hidden functions.
5. Hidden Transfer: Tokens can be transferred by others without permission.
6. Hidden Transfer Reverts: Transfer transactions can be reverted using changeable parameters.

Currently, this agent uses [invariant testing](https://book.getfoundry.sh/forge/invariant-testing) to detect the above-mentioned rugpulls. Invariant testing uses a set of invariants to test the correctness of a smart contract. For example, to detect `HiddenMints`, the following invariant can be used:

```solidity
assert(totalSupply() == initialSupply)
```

## Supported Chains

The agent supports all chains that Forta supports.

## Alerts

When one of the above-mentioned rugpulls is detected, the following alert is fired:

- **HARD-RUG-PULL-{RUGPULL_CATEGORY}-DYNAMIC**
  - Fired when a created token contract is detected to be suspicious.
  - Severity: Medium
  - Type: Suspicious
  - Metadata:
    - `attacker_deployer_address`: The address of the attacker's deployer contract.
    - `token_contract_address`: The address of the token contract.
    - `reason`: The reason for the alert.
    - `counterexample`: An example sequence of function calls that trigger the alert.

The following rugpull categories are supported:
 - HONEYPOT
 - HIDDENMINTS
 - FAKEOWNERSHIPRENOUNCIATION
 - HIDDENTRANSFERS
 - HIDDENFEEMODIFIERS
 - HIDDENTRANSFERREVERTS

When two or more of the above-mentioned rugpulls are detected, the agent will additionally fire the following alert:

- **HARD-RUG-PULL-1**
  - Fired when a created token contract is detected to be suspicious.
  - Severity: High
  - Type: Suspicious
  - Metadata:
    - `attacker_deployer_address`: The address of the attacker's deployer contract.
    - `token_contract_address`: The address of the token contract.

### How to Read the Counterexample and the Reason

Example:
```shell
{
  "attacker_deployer_address":"0xfb941dd93dac213ecb38d6728901ce20234acac5",
  "counterexample":"{\"Sequence\":[{\"sender\":\"0x7fa9385be102ac3eac297483dd6233d62b3e1496\",\"addr\":\"0x5615deb798bb3e4dfa0139dfa1b3d433cc23b72f\",\"calldata\":\"0xec28438a0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001\",\"signature\":\"setMaxTxAmount(uint256)\",\"contract_name\":\"test/test.sol:NETWORK\",\"traces\":{\"arena\":[{\"parent\":null,\"children\":[],\"idx\":0,\"trace\":{\"depth\":0,\"success\":true,\"contract\":null,\"label\":null,\"caller\":\"0x7fa9385be102ac3eac297483dd6233d62b3e1496\",\"address\":\"0x5615deb798bb3e4dfa0139dfa1b3d433cc23b72f\",\"kind\":\"CALL\",\"value\":\"0x0\",\"data\":{\"Raw\":\"0xec28438a0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001\"},\"output\":{\"Raw\":\"0x\"},\"gas_cost\":7457,\"status\":\"Stop\",\"call_context\":null,\"steps\":[]},\"ordering\":[]}]}}]}",
  "reason":"Transfer amount exceeds the maxTxAmount.",
  "token_contract_address":"0x1e9804d7a48F661871eFcdE4669b39263f47F3e4"
}
```

The sequence is an ordered list of transactions that trigger the rugpull. If you deploy a new contract and execute transactions as the sequence suggests, you will end up triggering the hard rugpull. In this example, it is the `HiddenTransferReverts` rugpull. The `reason` field gives the exact reason for the rugpull (in this case, it is because the transfer is reverted due to the error "Transfer amount exceeds the maxTxAmount", where `maxTxAmount` is set by the `setMaxTxAmount` function). In other words, if the deployer calls the `setMaxTxAmount` function with 0, the transfer of the token is effectively disabled because no transfer can be made, causing a hard rugpull.

## Running Locally

### Prerequisites

- nvm
- Node.js
- npm
- Forta CLI
- Docker (for containerized testing)

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables are required in an `.env` file (referencing the `.env.example` file):
```plaintext
EVM_RPC
TESTING
```

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
    ```shell
    git clone git@github.com:Soptq/forta-hard-rugpull.git
    cd forta-hard-rugpull
    ```

2. Install the currently supported Node.js version using nvm:
    ```shell
    nvm install
    nvm use
    ```

3. Install the current version of Foundry and follow the post-install steps output:
    ```shell
    curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
    ```

4. Install dependencies:
    ```shell
    npm install
    ```

5. Create a `.env` file from the `.env.example` file and add your API keys:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

6. Start the development server:
    ```shell
    npm run start
    ```

## Running with Docker

To run the project using Docker, follow these steps:

1. Build the Docker containers:
    ```shell
    docker-compose build --build-arg INSTALL_DEV=true --build-arg NODE_ENV=development
    ```

2. Start the containers:
    ```shell
    docker-compose up
    ```

This will build and start all services defined in the Docker Compose file. You can access the services locally as defined in the Docker Compose configuration.

## Testing

To test a specific transaction ([positive example](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x22369564145b28ae5eb75e9a37c213c2ccca1e01ffc597935f84aa24e9511cf1)), run:
```shell
npm run tx <transaction_id>
```

To test a token contract locally:
1. Get the transaction ID that deploys the token.
2. In the `handleTransaction()` function in `agent.js`, change `false` to `true` in the `provideHandleTransaction()` call:
    ```js
    // return await provideHandleTransaction(txEvent, false);
    return await provideHandleTransaction(txEvent, provider, true);
    ```
3. Run:
    ```shell
    npm run tx <transaction_id> chainId <chain_id>
    ```
